Hey, it's Matthew Getter.
I'm a homechool student and am interested in coding so I took a class on it from bethel tech this year

I'm a senior and haven't decide between trying to be an engineer at Virginia Tech or maybe continuing with cyber security with Bethel

In my free time I enjoy swimming competitively, riding dirt bikes and snowboarding with friends

I'm looking foward to the rest of this year!
