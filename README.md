Hey, it's Matthew Getter
I'm a homechool student and am interested in coding so I took a class on it from bethel tech this year
I'm a senior and can't decide between trying to be an engineer or maybe looking into cyber-security
In my free time I enjoy swimming competitively, riding dirt bikes and snowboarding with friends
I'm looking foward to the rest of this year!
